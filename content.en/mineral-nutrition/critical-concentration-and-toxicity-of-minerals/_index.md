# 12.5 Critical concentration and toxicity of minerals


## 12.5.1  Critical Concentration

To increase the productivity and also to avoid mineral toxicity knowledge of critical concentration is essential. Mineral nutrients lesser than critical concentration cause deficiency symptoms. Increase of mineral nutrients more than the normal concentration causes toxicity. A concentration, at which 10 % of the dry weight of tissue is reduced, is considered as toxic. Figure 12.2 explains about Critical Concentration.

### 12.5.2 Mineral Toxicity 

**a. Manganese toxicity**

Increased Concentration of Manganese will prevent the uptake of Fe and Mg, prevent translocation of Ca to the shoot apex and cause their deficiency. The symptoms of manganese toxicity are appearance of brown spots surrounded by chlorotic veins.

**b. Aluminium Toxicity** 

Aluminium toxicity causes precipitation of nucleic acid inhibition of ATPase, inhibition of cell division and binding of plasma membrane with Calmodulin.

For theories regarding, translocation of minerals please refer Chapter- 11.
