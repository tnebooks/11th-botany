#  Hydroponics and Aeroponics 

**1. Hydroponics or Soilless culture:Von Sachs** 

developed a method of growing plants in nutrient solution. The commonly used nutrient solutions are **Knop solution** (1865) and **Arnon** and **Hoagland** **Solution** (1940). Later the term Hydroponics was coined by **Goerick** (1940) and he also introduced commercial techniques for hydroponics. In hydroponics roots are immersed in the solution containing nutrients and air is supplied with help of tube (Figure 12.3).

**Aeroponics:** This technique was developed by **Soifer Hillel** and **David Durger**. It is a system where roots are suspended in air and nutrients are sprayed over the roots by a motor driven rotor (Figure 12.4).
