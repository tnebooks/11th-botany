**Introduction to Tissue System, Types and Characteristics of tissue System**

As you have learnt, the plant cells are organised into tissues, in turn the tissues are organised into organs. Different organs in a plant show differences in their internal structure. This part of chapter deals with the different type of internal structure of various plant organs and its adaptations to diverse environments.

A group of tissues performing a similar function, irrespective of its position in the plant body, is called a **_tissue system_**. In 1875, German Scientist **_Julius Von Sachs_** recognized three tissue systems in the plants. They are:

1. Epidermal tissue system (derived from protoderm)

2. Ground tissue system (derived from ground meristem)

3. Vascular tissue system (derived from procambium)
