>**Do You Know ?**
**Neurons can be replaced!**
**Stem cells in the human brain** - most neurons are in G 0 and do not divide. As neurons and neuroglia die or injured they are replaced by neural stem cells

One of the most important features of the living cells is their power to grow and divide. New cells are formed by the division of pre- existing cells. Cells increase in number by cell division. The parent cell divides and passes on genetic material to the daughter cells.
