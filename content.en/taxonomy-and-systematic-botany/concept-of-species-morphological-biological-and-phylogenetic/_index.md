## Concept of species-Morphological, Biological and Phylogenetic

Species is the fundamental unit of taxonomic classification. Species is a group of individual organisms which have the following characters.

1. A population of organisms which closely resemble each other more than the other population.
2. They descend from a common ancestor.
3. In sexually reproducing organisms, they interbreed freely in nature, producing fertile offspring.

Species concepts can be classified into two general groups. Concept emphasizing process of evolution that maintains the species as a unit and that can result in evolutionary divergence and speciation. Another concept emphasises the product of evolution in defining a species.

**Types of Species**

There are different types of species and they are as follows:

1. Process of evolution - Biological Species
2. Product of evolution - Morphological Species and Phylogenetic Species

**Morphological Species (Taxonomic species)**

When the individuals are similar to one another in one or more features and different from other such groups, they are called **morphological species.**

**Biological Species (Isolation Species)**

According to **Ernest Mayr** 1963,“ these are groups of populations that interbreed and are reproductively isolated from other such groups in nature”.

**Phylogenetic Species**

This concept was developed by **Meglitsch** (1954), **Simpson** (1961) and **Wiley** (1978). Wiley defined phylogenetic species as “an evolutionary species is a single lineage of ancestor descendent populations which maintains its identity from other such lineages which has its own evolutionary tendencies and historical fate”.
