## Taxonomy and Systematics

The word taxonomy is derived from Greek words **_“taxis”_** (arrangement) and **_“nomos”_** (rules or laws). Taxonomy is defined as as “the science dealing with the study of **Differences between Taxonomy and Systematics**

| **Taxonomy**                                                                         | **Systematics**                                                                              |

| - Discipline of classifying organisms into taxa.                                     | Broad field of biology that studies the diversification of species.                     |
| - Governs the practices of naming,describing, identifying and specimen preservation. | Governs the evolutionary history and phylogenetic relationship in addition to taxonomy. |
| - Classification + Nomenclature = Taxonomy                                           | Taxonomy + Phylogeny = Systematics                                                      |

**Species** is the lowest of classification and shows the high level of similarities among the organisms. For example, _Helianthus annuus_ and _Helianthus tuberosus_. These two species differ in their morphology. Both of them are herbs but _Helianthus tuberosus_ is a perennial herb.

**Genus** consists of multiple species which have similar characters but differ from the species of another genus. Example: _Helianthus_, _Tridax._

**Family** comprises a number of genera which share some similarities among them. Example: Asteraceae.

**Order** includes group of families which show less similarities among them.

**Class** consists of group of orders which share few similarities.

**Division** is the next level of classification that consists of number of classes.
Example: Magnoliophyta. classification including the bases, principles, rules and procedures”.`

Simpson (1961) defined Systematics as, “Scientific study of the kinds and diversity of organisms and all relationships among them”. Though there are two terms are used in an interchangeable way, they differ from each other.
