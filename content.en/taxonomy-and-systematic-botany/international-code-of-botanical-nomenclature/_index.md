## International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN)

Assigning name for a plant is known as **Nomenclature.** This is based on the rules and recommendations of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. ICBN deals with the names of existing (living) and extinct (fossil) organisms. The elementary rule of naming of plants was first proposed by **Linnaeus** in 1751 in his _Philosophia Botanica_. In 1813 a detailed set of rules regarding plant nomenclature was given by **A.P. de Candolle** in his famous work “_Theorie elementaire de la botanique_”. Then the present ICBN was evolved by following the same rules of **Linnaeus, A.P. de Candolle** and his son **Alphonse de Candolle.**

ICBN due to specific reasons and in order to separate plant kingdom from other organisms, is redesignated as ICN. The International Botanical Congress held in Melbourne in July 2011 brought this change. The ICN stands for International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi and Plants.

**ICN Principles**

International Code of Nomenclature is based on the following six principles.

1. Botanical nomenclature is independen of  zoological and bacteriological nomenclature.
2. Application of names of taxonomic group is determined by means of nomenclatural types.
3. Nomenclature of a taxonomic group is based on priority of publication.
4. Each taxonomic group with a particular circumscription, position and rank can bear only one correct name.
5. Scientific names of taxonomic groups are treated as Latin regardless of their derivation.
6. The rules of nomenclature are retroactive unless expressly limited.

**Codes of Nomenclature**

ICN has formulated a set of rules and recommendations dealing with the botanical name of plants. International Botanical Congress is held at different places every six years. Proposals for nomenclatural changes and changes in rules are discussed and implemented. Changes are published in their website.

18th International Botanical Congress held in 2011at Melbourne, Australia made the following major changes.

1. The code now permits electronic publication of names of new taxa.

2. Latin diagnosis or description is not mandatory and permits the use of English or Latin for the publication of a new name (Art-39).

3. “One fungus, one name” and “one fossil one name” are important changes, the concept of anamorph and teleomorph (for fungi) and morphotaxa (for fossils) have been eliminated. (Previously, sexual and asexual stages of the fungus/ fossils were provided with different names).

---

**Anamorph** – Asexual reproductive stage of fungus.

**Teleomorph** – Sexual reproductive stage of fungus.

4. As an experiment with “registration of names” new fungal descriptions require the use of an identifier from a “recognized repository”. There are two recognized repositories **Index fungorum** and **Myco Bank**.

19th International Botanical Congress was held in Shenzhen in China in 2017. Changes accepted by International Botanical Congress are yet to be published.

**Vernacular names (Common names)**

Vernacular names are known as **common names.** They are very often descriptive and poetic references to plants. Common name refer to more than one plant or many plants may have same common name. These names are regional or local and are not universal. Example: _Albizia amara_ . L belongs to _Mimosaceae_ is called as _Usilai_ in South Tamilnadu and _Thurinji_ in North Tamilnadu.

**Activity** Write common name and scientific name of 10 different plants around your home.

**Scientific Names / Botanical Names**

Each and every taxon as per the ICN (species, genus, family etc) can have only one correct scientific name. Scientific name of a species is always a binomial. These names are universally applied. Example: _Oryza sativa L._ is the scientific name of paddy.

**Polynomial**

Polynomial is a descriptive phrase of a plant. Example: _Ranunculus calycibus retroflexis pedunculis falcatis caule erecto folius compositis._ It means butter cup with reflexed sepals, curved flower stalks, erect stem and compound leaves. Polynomial system of naming a plant is replaced by a binomial system by Linnaeus.

**Binomial**

Binomial nomenclature was first introduced by **Gaspard Bauhin** and it was implemented by **Carolus Linnaeus**. Scientific name of a species consists of two words and according to binomial nomenclature, the first one is called **genus name** and second one is **specific epithet.** Example: _Mangifera indica_. _Mangifera_ is a genus name and _indica_ is specific epithet. This system is in vogue even now.

**Author citation**

This refers to valid name of the taxa accompanied by the author’s name who published the name validly. Example: _Solanum nigrum_ L. There are two types of author citation.

**Single author**: When a single author proposed a valid name, the name of the author alone is accompanied by his abbreviated name. Example: _Pithecellobium cinereum_ Benth.

**Multiple authors**: When two or more authors are associated with a valid publication of name, their names should be noted with the help of Latin word _et_ or &. Example: _Delphinium viscosum_ Hook. f. _et_ Thomson.

**Standard form of author’s abbreviations has to be followed.**
