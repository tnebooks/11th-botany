## Botanical Gardens

In true sense all gardens are not botanical gardens. Botanical gardens are centres for collection of plants in their various stages of living. Gardens existed for growing ornamental plants for aesthetic value, religious and status reasons. The famous “hanging gardens” of Babylon in Mesopotamia is an example. For the purpose of science and education the first garden was maintained by **Theophrastus** in his public lecture hall at Athens. First modern botanical garden was established by **Luca Ghini** (1490-1556) a professor of Botany at Pisa, Italy in 1544.

Botanical garden contains special plant collections such as cacti, succulent, green house, shade house, tropical, alpine and exotic plants. Worldwide there are about 1800 botanical gardens and arboreta.
