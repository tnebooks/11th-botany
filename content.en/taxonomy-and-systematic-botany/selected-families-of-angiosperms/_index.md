**General characters**

**Distribution:** Fabaceae includes about 741 genera and more than 20,200 species. The members are cosmopolitan in distribution but abundant in tropical and subtropical regions.

**Habit:** All types of habits are represented in this family. Mostly herbs (_Crotalaria_), prostrate (_Indigofera enneaphylla)_ erect (_Crotalaria verrucosa_), shrubs (_Cajanus_ _cajan_), small trees (_Sesbania_), climbers (_Clitoria_), large tree (_Pongamia, Dalbergia_), woody climber (_Mucuna_), hydrophyte (_Aeschynomene aspera_) commonly called **pith plant.**

**Root:** Tap root system, roots are nodulated, have tubercles containing nitrogen – fixing bacteria (_Rhizobium leguminosarum)_
![Alt text](5.13.png)

**Stem:** Aerial, herbaceous, woody (_Dalbergia_) twining or climbing (_Clitoria)_.

**Leaf:** Leaf simple or unifoliate (_Desmodium gangeticum_) bifoliate (_Zornia diphylla,_), Trifoliate (_Lablab_ _purpureus)_, alternate, stipulate, leaf base, **pulvinate**, reticulate venation terminal leaflet modifies into a **tendril** in _Pisum sativum._

**Inflorescence:** Raceme (_Crotalaria verrucosa_), panicle (_Dalbergia latifolia_) axillary solitary (_Clitoria ternatea_)

**Flowers:** Bracteate, bracteolate, pedicellete, complete, bisexual, pentamerous, heterochlamydeous, zygomorphic hypogynous or sometimes perigynous.

**Calyx:** Sepals 5, green, synsepalous, more or less united in a tube and persistant, valvate or imbricate, odd sepal is anterior in position.

**Corolla:** Petals 5, apopetalous, unequal and **papilionaceous**, **vexillary** or **descendingly imbricate** aestivation, all petals have claw at the base. The outer most petal is large called **standard petal** or **vexillum**, Lateral 2 petals are lanceolate and curved. They are called **wing petals** or **alae**. Anterior two petals are partly fused and are called **keel petals** or **carina** which encloses the stamens and pistil.

**Androecium:** Stamens 10, diadelphous, usually 9+1 (_Clitoria ternatea_). The odd stamen is posterior in position. In _Aeschynomene aspera_, the stamens are fused to form two bundles each containing five stamens (5)+(5). Stamens are **monadelphous** and **dimorphic** ie. 5 stamens have longer filaments and other 5 stamens have shorter filaments thus the stamens are found at two levels and the shape of anthers also varies in (_Crotalaria verrucosa)_. (5 anthers are long and lanceolate, and the other 5 anthers are short and blunt). Anthers are dithecous,besifixed and dehiscing longitudinallly.
![Alt text](5.14.png)

**Gynoecium:** Monocarpellary, unilocular, ovary superior, with two alternating rows of ovules on marginal placentation. Style simple and bent, stigma flattened or feathery.

**Fruit:** The characteristic fruit of Fabaceae is a legume (_Pisum sativum)_, sometimes indehiscent and rarely a lomentum (_Desmodium)_. In _Arachis hypogea_ the fruit is _**geocarpic**_ (fruits develops and matures under the soil). After fertilization the stipe of the ovary becomes meristematic and grows down into the soil. This ovary gets buried into the soil and develops into fruit.

Seed: Endospermic or non- endospermic (_Pisum sativum_), mostly **reniform**.

Note: Earlier Musaceae was a large family with 6 genera viz. _Musa, Ensete, Ravenala, Strelitzia, Orchidantha_ and _Heliconia_. In APG only Musa and Ensete are retained while _Ravenala, Strelitzia, Orchidantha_ and _Heleconia_ are separated.

---

**General Characters**
**Distribution**

Musaceae includes only 2 genera (_Musa_ and _Ensete) and 81 species. The members of this_ family are mainly wet tropical lowlands from West Africa to Pacific (southern Japan to Queensland). (_Musa_ is the most common plant of the family found in India)

**Habit:** Large perennial herbs perennating by means of rhizome ( _Musa paradisiaca_), raraly trees (_Ravenala madagascariensis)_.

**Root:** Fibrous adventitious root system. 
**Stem:** In _Musa_ the real stem is found underground called rhizomatous (dichotomously branching in atleast some spp). The apparent aerial erect, unbranched tall pseudostem is formed by the long stiff and sheathy leaf bases which are rolled around one another to form an aerial pseudostem. The central axis that is concealed at the bottom of the pseudostem in called shaft, which elongates and pierces through the pseudostem at the time of flowering and produces inflorescence terminally. (Musa) monocarpic Stem is aerial and woody in (Ravenala madagascariensis.)

**Leaf:** Simple with long and strong petiole, the leaf blade is large and broad with sheathy leaf base. The leaf is exstipulate. Oval, obtuse or oblong with a stout midrib, entire, numerous parallel veins extending up to the margin, rolled in bud. Phyllotaxy is spiral in _Musa_ and distichous i.e. leaves are arranged alternately in two opposite vertical rows in _Ravenala_.

**Inflorescence:**
Terminal or axillary thyrse of one to many monochasial branched spadix in Musa, Usually the flowers are protected by large brightly coloured, spirally arranged, boat shaped bract called spathe. Compound cyme in _Ravenala._

**Flowers:** Bracteate, ebracteolate, sessile, trimerous, unisexual or bisexual or polygamous, when unisexual the flowers are monoecious. Flowers are zygyomorphic and epigynous. (In Musa flowers are polygamous i.e. staminate flowers, pistilate flowers and bisexual flowers are present in the same plant).

**Perianth:** Tepals 6, biseriate, arranged in two whorls of 3 each and homochlamydeous, 3 +3 syntepalous. In most of the species of _Musa,_ the three outer tepals and two lateral tepals of the inner whorl are fused to form 5 toothed tube like structure called **abaxial lip**. The posterior inner median tepal alone is free, which is distinctly broad and membranous called **labellum**.

**Androecium:** Stamens 5 or 6, arranged in two whorls of 3 each opposite and adnate to the tepals. In _Musa,_ only 5 stamens are fertile and the inner posterior stamen is either absent or represented by a staminode. In _Ravenala,_ all the six stamens are fertile. Filaments free, anthers linear, dithecous dehisce by longitudinal slits, and with sticky pollen.

**Gynoecium:** Tricarpallary, syncarpous, trilocular ovary inferior, ovules many, axile, placentation, style filiform, stigma three lobed septal nectaries are present.

**Fruit:** Elongated thesh (_musa_) berry containing numerous seeds, fruits forming compact bunches, seeds with copious and small embryo in _Musa_. Capsule in _Ravenala._

**General Characters Distribution:** Liliaceae are fairly large family comprising about 15 genera and 550 species. Members of this family are widely distributed over most part of the world.

**Habit:** Mostly perennial herbs persisting by means of a sympodial rhizome (_Polygonatum)_, by a bulb (_Lilium_) corm (_Colchicum_), shrubby or tree like (_Yucca_ and _Dracaena_). Woody climbers, climbing with the help of stipular tendrils in _Smilax_. Trees in (_Xanthorrhoea),_ succulents (_Aloe)_.

**Root:** Adventitious and fibrous, and typically contractile.

**Stem:** Stems usually bulbous, rhizomatous in some, aerial, erect (_Dracaena_) or climbing (_Smilax)_ in _Ruscus_ the ultimate branches are modified into phylloclades, In Asparagus stem is modified into cladodes and the leaves are reduced to scales.

**Leaf:** Leaves are radical (_Lilium_) or **cauline** (_Dracaena_), usually alternate, opposite (Gloriosa), sometimes fleshy and hollow, reduced to scales (_Ruscus_ and _Asparagus). The venation is parallel but_ in species of _Smilax_ it is reticulate. Leaves are usually exstipulate, but in _Smilax_, two tendrils arise from the base of the leaf, which are considered modified stipules.

**Inflorescence:** Flowers are usually borne in simple or branched racemes (_Asphodelus_) spikes in _Aloe_, huge terminal panicle in _Yucca_, solitary and axillary in _Gloriosa_, solitary and terminal in _Tulipa._

**Flowers:** Flowers are often showy, pedicellate, bracteate, ebracteolate, except _Dianella_ and _Lilium_, bisexual, actinomorphic, trimerous, hypogynous, rarely unisexual (_Smilax_) and are dioecious, rarely tetramerous (_Maianthemum_), slightly zygomorphic (_Lilium_) and hypogynous.

**Summary**

Taxonomy deals with the identification,naming and classification of plants. But systematics deals with evolutionary relationship between the organisms in addition to taxonomy. Taxonomic hierarchy was introduced by Carolus Linnaeus. It also includes ranks. Species is the fundamental unit of taxonomic classification. Species concept can be classified into two groups based on the process of evolution and product of evolution. There are three types of species, morphological, biological and phylogenetic species. Taxonomic aids are the tools for the taxonomic study such as keys, flora, revisions, catalogues, botanical gardens and herbaria. Botanical gardens serve different purposes. They have aesthetic value, offers scope for botanical research, conservation of rare species and propagation of many species. Botanical survey of India explores and documents biodiversity all over India. It has 11 regional centres in India. Herbarium preparation includes plant collection, documentation of field data, preparation of plant specimens, mounting and labelling. There are several national and international herbaria. National herbaria include MH, PCM, CAL etc. Kew herbarium is the world’s largest one.

Classification is the basis for cataloguing and retrieving information about the tremendous diversity of flora. It helps us to know about different varieties, their phylogenetic relationship and exact position. Some important systems of classification are fall in to three types; artificial,natural and phylogenetic. Carolus Linnaeus outlined an artificial system of classification in “_Species Plantarum_” in 1753. The first scheme of classification based on overall similarities was presented by Antoine Laurent De Jessieu in 1789. A widely followed natural system of classification was proposed by George Bentham (1800 - 1884) and Joseph Dalton Hooker. This system was not intended to be phylogenetic. One of the earliest phylogenetic systems of classification was jointly proposed by Adolf Engler and Karl A Prantl in a monumental work “**_Die Naturelichen Pflanzen Familien_**”. Arthur Cronquist proposed phylogenetic classification of flowering plants based on a wide range of taxonomic characters including anatomical and phytochemical of phylogenetic importance in his book titled “The evolution and classification of flowering plants.” Angiosperm phylogeny group (APG) classification is the most recent classification of flowering plants based on phylogenetic data. APG system is an evolving and currently accepted system across the world and followed by all the leading taxonomic institutions and practising taxonomists.

Cladistics is the methodology, used to classify organisms into monophyletic groups, consisting of all the descents of the common ancestors. The outcome of a cladistic analysis is a cladogram and is constructed to represent the best hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships. Chemotaxonomy is the scientific approach of classification of plants on the basis of their biochemical constituents in them. Utilization of the characters of chromosome for the taxonomic inference is known as karyotaxonomy. The application of serology in solving taxonomic problems is called serotaxonomy. Molecular Taxonomy is the branch of phylogeny that analyses hereditary molecular differences, mainly in DNA nuclear and chloroplast sequences, to gain information and to establish genetic relationship between the members of different taxonomic categories. Different molecular markers like allozymes, mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites, RAPDs, AFLPs, single nucleotide polymorphism- (SNP), microchips or arrays are used in analysis. Molecular Taxonomy unlocks the treasure chest of information on evolutionary history of organisms. It plays a vital role in phytogeography, which ultimately helps in genome mapping and biodiversity conservation. DNA barcoding is a taxonomic method that uses a very short genetic sequence from a standard part of a genome. It helps in identification of organisms.
