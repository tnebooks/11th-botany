# Discovery

**Aristotle** (384-322BC), was the one who first recognised that animals and plants consists of organised structural units but unable to explain what it was. In 1660’s **Robert Hooke** observed something which looks like ‘honeycomb with a great numbers of little boxes’ which was later called as ‘**cell**’ from the cork tissue. In 1665, He compiled his work as **Micrographia**. Later, **Anton Van Leeuwenhoek** observed unicellular particles which he named as ‘**_animalcules_**’. **Robert Brown** (1831-39) described the spherical body in plant cell as nucleus. **H. J. Dutrochet** (1824), a French scientist, was the first to give an idea on cell theory. Later, **Matthias Schleiden** (German Botanist) and **Theodor Schwann** (German Zoologist) (1833) outlined the basic features of the cell theory. **Rudolf Virchow** (1858) explained the cell theory by adding a feature stating that all living cells arise from pre-existing living cells by ‘cell division’.
