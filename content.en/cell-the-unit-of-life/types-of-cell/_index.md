# Types of Cell

On the basis of the cellular organization and the nuclear characteristics, the cell can be classified into
- Prokaryote. 
- Mesokaryotes an. 
- Eukaryotes

### Prokaryotes

Those organisms with primitive nucleus are called as **prokaryotes** (_pro_ – primitive; _karyon_ – nucleus). The DNA lies in the ‘nucleoid’ which is not bound by the nuclear membrane and therefore it is not a true nucleus and is also a primitive type of nuclear material. The DNA is without histone proteins. Example: Bacteria, blue green algae, Mycoplasma, Rickettsiae and Spirochaetae. 

### Mesokaryotes

In the year 1966, scientist **Dodge** and his coworkers proposed another kind of organisms called **mesokaryotes**. These organisms which shares some of the characters of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In other words these are organisms intermediate between pro and eukaryotes. These contains well organized nucleus with nuclear membrane and the DNA is organized into chromosomes but without histone protein components divides through amitosis similar with prokaryotes. Certain Protozoa like **Noctiluca**, some phytoplanktons like _Gymnodinium_, _Peridinium_ and Dinoflagellates are representatives of mesokaryotes.

### Eukaryotes

Those organisms which have true nucleus are called **Eukaryotes** (_Eu_ – True; _karyon_ – nucleus). The DNA is associated with histones forming the chromosomes. Membrane bound organelles are present. Few organelles may have risen by **endosymbiosis** which is a cell living inside another cell. The Organelles like mitochondria and chloroplast well support this theory.

**Origin of Eukaryotic cell:**

---
**Endosymbiont theory:** Two eukaryotic organelles believed to be the descendants of the endosymbiotic prokaryotes. The ancestors of the eukaryotic cell engulfed a bacterium and the bacteria continued to function inside the host cell.

**Comparison between types of cellular organisation**
|Features |Prokaryotes |Mesokaryotes |Eukaryotes |
|------|------|------|------|
| Size of the cell | ~1-5µm |~5-10µm |~10-100µm |
| Nuclear character |Nucleoid , no true nucleus,|No cleus with nuclear membrane |True nucleus with nuclear membrane |
| DNA |Usually circular without  histone proteins |Usually linear but without histone proteins |Usually line ar with histone proteins |
| RNA/Protein synthesis | Couples in cytoplasm |Similar with eukaryotes |RNA synthesis inside nucleus/ Protein synthesis in cytoplasm |
| Ribosomes |50S+ 30S |60S + 40S |60S + 40S |
| Organelles |Absent |Present |Numer ous |
| Cell  movement | Flagella |Gliding and flagella | Flagella and cilia |
| Organization |Usually single cell |Single and colony |Single , colonial and multicellular |
| Cell division | Binary fission |Binary fission | Mitosis and meiosis |
| Examples |Bacteria and Archaea |Dinoflagel late,Protozoa |Fungi, plants and animals |
