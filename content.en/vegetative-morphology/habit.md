# Habit

The general form of a plant is referred as habit. Based on habit, plants are classified into herbs, shrubs, climbers (vines) and trees.

**I. Herbs**

Herbs are soft stemmed plants with less wood or no wood. Example: _Phyllanthus amarus, Cleome viscosa._ According to the duration of their life they may be classified as **annuals**, **biennials** and **perennials**. Perennial herbs having a bulb, corm, rhizome or tuber as the underground stem are termed as **geophytes.** Example: _Allium cepa_

**II. Shrubs**

A shrub is a perennial, woody plant with several main stems arising from the ground level. Example: _Hibiscus rosa sinensis (\_shoe flower_)\_

**III. Climbers (Vine)**

An elongated weak stem generally supported by means of climbing devices are called **Climbers** (vines) which may be annual or perennial, herbaceous or woody. **Liana** is a vine that is perennial and woody. Liana’s are major components in the tree canopy layer of some tropical forests. Example: _Ventilago, Entada_, _Bougainvillea._

**IV. Trees**

A tree is a stout, tall, perennial, woody plant having one main stem called **trunk** with many lateral branches. Example: Mango, Sapota, Jack, Fig, Teak. If the trunk remains unbranched it is said to be **caudex.** Example: Palmyra, Coconut.
