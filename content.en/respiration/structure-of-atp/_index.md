# Structure of ATP

Respiration is responsible for generation of ATP. The discovery of ATP was made by **Karl Lohman** (1929). ATP is a nucleotide consisting of a base-adenine, a pentose sugar-ribose and three phosphate groups. Out of three phosphate groups the last two are attached by high energy rich bonds (Figure 14.3). On hydrolysis, it releases energy (7.3 K cal or 30.6 KJ/ATP) and it is found in all living cells and hence it is called **universal energy currency of the cell**. ATP is an instant source of energy within the cell. The energy contained in ATP is used in synthesis carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. The energy transformation concept was established by **Lipman** (1941).
