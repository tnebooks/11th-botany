# Redox Reactions

`formulae`
`NAD+ + 2e - + 2H+ NADH + H+`

`FAD + 2e- + 2H+ FADH2`


When NAD+ (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide-oxidised form) and FAD (Flavin Adenine Dinucleotide) pick up electrons and one or two hydrogen ions (protons), they get reduced to NADH + H+ and FADH2 respectively. When they drop electrons and hydrogen off they go back to their original form. The reaction in which NAD+ and FAD gain (reduction) or lose (oxidation) electrons are called **redox reaction** (Oxidation reduction reaction). These reactions are important in cellular respiration.
